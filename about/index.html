        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>I'm Simon Wu. I'm currently a student at The Woodlands Secondary School. I really like math, programming, physics and music, so that's what most of this site's content will be.</p>
        <p>I started programming when I was 10, when I began an Arduino class. Ever since then, I've done all sorts of little Arduino projects that I hope to document here.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy modelling in Autodesk Inventor, competitive programming, DECA, music production with Garageband/Logic Pro X, math, and physics.</p>
        <p>If you see a typo or something, shoot me an message; my email's in the footer.</p>
