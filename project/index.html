        		<h1>Our project</h1>
				<p>
					Our project is to research methods of power generation involving generators, and to build a small hand-powered generator.
					Power generation is an important part of modern civilization: massive amounts of electricity fuel innovation and make
					tasks once thought to be incredibly difficult or impossible trivial.
				</p>
				<p>
					We wish to use this project to explore some methods of power generation, especially those involving generators, and show
					how varied these methods can be, with everything from turning a hand crank to operating a massive nuclear power plant.
