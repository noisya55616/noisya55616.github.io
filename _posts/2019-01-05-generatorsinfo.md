# What are generators?

Generators are devices that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.

They're pretty cool, and play an incredibly important role in our society: our societies uses more and more electricity every day to fuel recreation, manufacturing and research, and understanding generators helps you to understand how we get our electricity.

## History of generators

Generators have been evolving for many centuries, but almost all generators evolved from the work of famous scientists Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in the 1830s. They discovered electromagnetic induction, which today is known as “Faraday’s Law”. Faraday’s Law states that electromotive force can be generated by surrounding a magnetic field with a conductive material. Faraday used this principle to create the Faraday Disk - the first generator.

## Applications of generators

Generators are used for many many things. They are responsible for much of the electricity we use. They are used in many forms of electricity generation e.g. wind turbines and water-powered generators in hydroelectric power stations. They are behind almost every single method of modern power generation and play a mssive role in society overall.

## How do generators work?

Generators work similar tp electric motors, but in reverse. Instead of converting electrical energy to mechanical energy like a normal motor, generators convert mechanical energy into mechanical energy. This property was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831: by moving a wire near a magnetic field, current can be induced, which generates current. This is known as Faraday’s law, which is mentioned above. 

One fun fact: motors and generators are built in very, very similar ways, and many electric motors can be used as adequate generators by having something spin the shaft of the motor to generate electricity. This is in fact how we built our own small generator model!
