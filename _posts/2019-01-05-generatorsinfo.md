# What are generators?

Devices that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.

They're pretty cool!

# History of generators

Generators have been evolving for many centuries. But generators evolved from the work of famous scientists Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in the 1830s. They discovered electromagnetic induction, which today is known as “Faraday’s Law”. Faraday’s Law states that electromotive force can be generated by surrounding a magnetic field with a conductive material. Faraday used this principle to create the Faraday Disk - the first generator.

# Applications of generators

Generators are used for many many things. They are responsible for much of the electricity we use. They are used in many forms of electricity generation e.g. wind turbines and water-powered generators.

# How do generators work?

Kinda like an electric motor but in reverse. Instead of converting electrical energy to mechanical energy, generators convert mechanical energy into mechanical energy. This property was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. By moving a wire near a magnetic field, current can be induced, which generates current. This is known as Faraday’s law.
