## How I figured it out

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdgiTQffiwk) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZYttdxLFL4) gave me the idea to build this small generator model.

## How to build

It really isn't that hard to build and a basic one doesn't require very many materials.

### Materials I used

* Small electric motor
* Breadboard
* Wires
* LED light
* Skewers and tape (for handle)

Not very many things at all!

### Build process

This build process is very simple.

Firstly, I soldered some wires to the motor. You could probably also simply twist them on to the motor contacts, but in my case the type of wires I had and the metal motor enclosure meant that I had to solder the wires.

Secondly, I attached my wires and LED to a breadboard to test the direction of spin that I needed to correctly turn on the LED, and to see if the motor actually worked. You must verify what direction of spin you need on your motor if you wsh to reproduce this yourself: if you use an LED light, it will only light up if electricity is flowing a a certain direction (light emitting ***diode***), and the flow of electrons will go in a different direction if you reverse the spin of the motor shaft.

Finally, I built and attached a handle to my motor shaft. If you are looking to build your own, any handle you make should suffice as long as it is sturdy andlong enough to get the motor shaft to enough speed to turn on the LED light. In my case I used some bamboo skewer pieces and hot glue, but there are a number of ways to go about it.

Here is a picture and video of it working!
