# What are motors?

A motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Motors are used in many everyday things, like cars and laptops.

# How motors work

When electric current flows across a wire, a magnetic field is created along the wire. This magnetism can interact with other magnets. This is a crucial part of how motors work. One way to remember the behavior of the magnetic field is with the right-hand rule. If you make a thumbs up symbol with your hand around the wire, current is flowing in the direction your thumb is pointing, then the magnetic field will be travelling in the direction your other fingers are pointing.

So if you change the direction of the current continuously, you can manipulate the magnetic field as you wish.

The motor has a coil and when electrons flow through it, a magnetic field is created. 

This magnetic field turns on and off when there is current. By turning the field on, rotors gain momentum because the rotors are magnetic too. 

# Brushed vs unbrushed: What’s the difference?

Brushed motors have “brushes” which are used to deliver current, whereas brushless motors use another set of electrical componentry to transfer energy.

Brushless motors are more power efficient, durable, and overall just better compared to brushed motors although much more expensive. But we have no money, so we will be using a brushed motor for our project.
