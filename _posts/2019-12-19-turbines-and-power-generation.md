# Turbines

Turbines are an important part of many methods of energy production. 
Although they look complicated, their function isn't and they are actually pretty cool. 
When you understand how they work and what they do, they are very simple.

## How Do Turbines Work?

A common misconception is that generators produce electricity, but they actually convert other types of energy into electricity. 
By themselves generators turn mechanical energy into electricity, but with turbines they can be used to transform other types of energy.
Turbines are made to extract energy from the flow of a fluid and turn it into rotational energy.
Paired with a generator, the turbine spins the generator, and the generator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy
to be used.

Here are 3 different methods of generating power that use turbines, that are each very different.

# Wind Turbines

Wind turbines function hin a fairly intuitive way. 
The wind blows the turbine in a circle, and the generator inside converts the rotational energy into electricity. 
To ensure that the wind turbine spins in the right direction, the blades are designed like the wings on an airplane. 
This is to maximize lift and minimize drag. 
Wind turbines are often placed in large fields and spaced apart perfectly to maximize the amount of wind each turbine receives.

# Hydroelectric Turbines

Hydroelectric turbines work similarly to wind turbines, with water rather than air. 
A turbine is placed in flowing water, and it spins it. 
This is done most commonly using the potential energy from a drop: water is dammed and falls a large distance, and the energy from this fall
is transferred from the flowing water into mechanical energy by the turbine and then into electricity by the generator.
These play a large role in the power generation of many places. 
In fact, the Niagara Falls power generating stations supply one quarter of all power used in New York State and Ontario!

# Nuclear Turbines

Nuclear power plants are very different than the other power generation methods mentioned here. 
Nuclear power is generated using the fission of atoms in a reactor core.
The fission of atoms releases a massive amount of energy, which is used to heat up water in the reactor.
This hot water creates steam that flows past a turbine, which takes the energy from the movement created by heat and rotates,
and a generator generates electricity from this.
