This is a pretty cool problem that a friend showed me. It looks harder than it is (which is good for me, because I'm not actually that good at math), and I think the solution is interesting for its simplicity. It's question 12 from the OMO Fall 2012 contest. Check out the problems from that season's OMO [here](http://internetolympiad.org/archive/OMOFall12/OMOFall12Probs.pdf), and check out the OMO in general [here.](http://internetolympiad.org/)

Let $a_1,a_2,...$ be a sequence defined by $a_1 = 1$ and for $n \geq 1, a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a^{2}_{n} - 2a_n + 3} + 1$. Find $a_513$.

Pretty interesting, huh? Let's dive into it.

Where do we start? Let's try just evaluating a few terms of the squence first.

We are given that $a_1 = 1$, so

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
a_2 &=& \sqrt{a^{2}_{1} - 2a_1 + 3} + 1      \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{1^{2} - 2(1) + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{1 - 2 + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{2} + 1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$
